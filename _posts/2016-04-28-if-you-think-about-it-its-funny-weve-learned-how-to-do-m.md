If you think about it, it's funny. We've learned how to do math. We've learned about science and literature. I can even remember learning how to balance a check back in eighth grade.

But we were never taught how to love. There are no classes. No textbook chapter is dedicated to it. We go into love blind.

And we're silly enough to believe that, because love is a natural phenomenon, we don't need to learn how to do it properly.

Do you know what else is natural? Running. But we have professional athletes and trainers. Talking is natural, but we have professional speakers. Thinking is also natural, and we have scholars and philosophers.

Love may be instinctive but there are certainly better and worse ways to love. There is certainly plenty to learn.

But for some reason, we don't write a lesson plan for love. Loving is arguably the most important thing people do in life, but we don't teach our kids how to do it properly.

So what happens when the most intelligent people on this planet experience love? They question it. They want to better understand it, explore it and test it.

Get stuck on a math problem, and it'll drive you nuts. Get stuck trying to figure out love, and it almost certainly will drive you _mad_.
