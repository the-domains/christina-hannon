I don't pursue things halfheartedly. I either become addicted, or I don't care. Growing up, when I had a crush, I crushed hard, consumed by daydreams of a certain boy. When I would diet or start an exercise routine, I would start out incredibly intense. As an entrepreneur, I would stay up through that initial night working frantically when I had a fascinating new idea. I know these probably seem like normal examples of passion. But I pursue my next fix at the expense of other things, at the expense of balance, and at the expense of being healthy and functional. 

I am addicted to coffee. I love coffee. It excites me thinking about sitting. Notice I didn't say that coffee relaxes me or that it helps me as I meditate or plan my day. In fact, coffee has a rather unhelpful effect on me: it is one more way that I procrastinate things that need to get done; it leaves me jittery and with a rapid heart rate; and it's one more expense that I incur daily. Coffee is just one of my addictions. It is both exciting and unhelpful. When I finish my two cups of coffee in the morning, I barely feel satisfied, and I will often find an excuse to have more caffeine later on in the day. My excuse is that my life is busy. But really, it's just the addiction talking.
